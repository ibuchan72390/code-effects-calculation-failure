Implementation details:

- The /Models/ folder contains the Patient.cs source object and all other data types used by the Rule Editor.

- /Views/Home/Index.cshtml declares divRuleEditor DIV (line 12) that hosts Rule Editor.

- The /Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml file references two Code Effects style files - /wwwroot/css/codeeffects.common.css and /wwwroot/css/codeeffects.white.css (lines 10 and 11). It also declares the client function getEducationTypes() (line 22) used by the /Models/Patient.cs source object as Dynamic Menu Data Source for its EducationID property.

- The /Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml file also references two scripts - /wwwroot/lib/codeeffects/codeeffects.js (line 47) that comes with Code Effects package and declares the Rule Editor, and the /wwwroot/js/site.js (line 63) that initializes the editor and handles all UI functionality.

- The /Views/Home/Index.cshtml view declares DIV container that hosts the Rule Editor in markup (line 12).

- The /Controllers/HomeController.cs class declares web methods used by /wwwroot/js/site.js script to transfer json data to and from the editor.

- Rules are saved to and loaded from the /wwwroot/rules/ folder. The /Services/StorageService.cs class handles all rule storage functionality. In an actual production project, you probably want to use a database as a rules storage.



Reproduction Steps

I have already saved an example rule demonstrating the failure that I'm seeing locally.
I have included a modified version of the JS library that is currently broken to demonstrate that even when the rule loads and calculates, it calculates incorrectly.

- Open the project and begin debug mode.

- Click the rules dropdown and load the "Calculation Failure" rule.

- Simply hit the "Test" button and you should get a modified message back demonstrating the failure.

- The final two liness of the calculation are never taken into account despite it being properly tracked in the XML.
